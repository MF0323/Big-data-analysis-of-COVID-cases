# Big-data-analysis-of-COVID-cases

## Lab 01
1. Performed basic data import and data cleaning
2. Fitted and evaluate a simple predictive model using a small data set in a simple format
3. Generated a literate report

## Lab 02: Work in Linux
Performed a simple analysis like lab 01, but this time we will fit a linear regression model and process the R markdown file on Linux.

## Lab 03: Prosper in Linux
1. Generated a literate report that describes a simple analysis, but this time work with a messier data set and use Linux tools to check the data before we read it into R.
2. In addition to fitting a simple logistic regression model, like in the lab 01, assessed the model using k-fold cross validation
3. Used Linux tools to bundle the lab report for submission

## Lab 04: Work with JSON and XML data 
Note: The data set for this lab is provided in several different formats
Generated a literate report that describes a simple analysis, but this time compare a simple linear regression model to a polynomial regression model

## Lab 05: Access data from the Web
Generated a literate report, but it will mostly be about accessing the data

## Lab 06: Explore memory usage
Generated a literate report that describes a simple logistic regression analysis, relating risk of death to age, but focus on understanding the memory requirements of the analysis.

## Lab 07: Try to limit memory usage
Generated a literate report that describes a simple logistic regression analysis, relating risk of death to age, but focus on reducing the memory requirements of the analysis.

## Lab 08: Measure and improve code efficiency
Generated a literate report that describes a simple logistic regression analysis, relating risk of death to age, but focus on the time taken to perform the analysis.

## Lab 09: Parallel computing
Generated a literate report that describes a simple logistic regression analysis, relating risk of death to age, but focus on performing the analysis in parallel.

## Lab 10: Hadoop and Spark
Generated a literate report that describes a simple logistic regression analysis, relating risk of death to age, but focus on performing the analysis with Hadoop and Spark.
